It\'s important to note that this industry includes not only drug manufacturers, but also the sellers of medical products and nutritional and dietary supplements. In 2018, spending was topped by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and Pfizer.\n\nOverall, the industry is primarily concerned with "resisting government-run health care, ensuring a quicker approval process for drugs and products entering the market and strengthening intellectual property protections.” In recent years, lobbying has focused more specifically “on the patent system, research funding and Medicare.” As is to be expected, lobbying efforts reached a fever pitch in 2009, around the drafting of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and reported a high in 2017 with legislative enactments again focusing on changes to health care.\n\nInsurance: $2,704,636,807\n\nIncluding health, property and car insurance companies, agents and brokers, the insurance industry has historically been the second most generous/aggressive industry in lobbying for their interests. In 2017, spending was $160.5 million.  Following the passage of the ACA and subsequent developments under the Trump Administration, health insurance companies have been very involved in the legislative process, looking to influence new regulations. In 2018, the leading insurance industry lobbyist corporation was Blue Cross Blue Shield.\n\nElectric Utilities: $2,353,570,360\n\nThe electronic utilities industry monitors legislative and regulatory action taken on a number of fronts, including clean air regulation, waste storage, cybersecurity and infrastructure. The top lobbyist in electric utilities as of Oct. 2018 is Southern Company.\n\nElectronics Manufacturing and Equipment: $2,230,043,875\n\nThese are your classic software and hardware computer tech companies, some of the founders of the tech movement that exists today. As this industry has become increasingly profitable, its political contributions have increased. The industry is relatively non-partisan, usually giving to each party evenly, with slight favoring to the party in the White House. Given the ubiquity of hardware and software, and tech more generally, it makes sense that lobbying from this industry is varied, with lobbying efforts on homeland security, taxes, copyright, immigration, human rights, cybersecurity and law enforcement data storage. The top lobbying spender was Microsoft in 2018. \n\nBusiness Associations: $2,217,425,929\n\nThis grouping includes small business, pro-business and international trade associations, as well as chambers of commerce. Business associations lobby on issues like labor regulations, intellectual property, product safety and taxes, but mostly, lobbying efforts have focused on civil justice system reform. Business associations want to make sure that damages awarded to plaintiffs involving torts or wrongful acts that led to legal liabilities are limited (asbestos, medical malpractice, etc.). Other important issues also include business tax reform, including corporate tax policy and taxation of U.S. subsidiaries of foreign companies. The top business association lobbyist in 2018 was the U.S Chamber of Commerce.\n\nOil &amp; Gas: $2,096,923,653\n\nAs you might imagine, the oil and gas lobbying sector is one of the most active lobbying groups. Lobbyist efforts have historically focused on promoting legislators with pro-energy views in the areas of fossil fuel production, and commodity exploration and extraction. In 2018, the top lobbying spenders in the industry have been Exxon and Chevron.\n\nMiscellaneous Manufacturing and Distributing: $1,687,618,725\n\nWith spending of nearly $1.7 billion in lobbying efforts, miscellaneous manufacturing and distributing is an influential force in legislation and governmental regulation.  The sector has members like Honeywell International, General Electric, Cummins Inc., 3M, and Procter &amp; Gamble, and its lobbying interests and efforts reflect this wide array. Having spent $3.8 million in 2018, the National Association of Manufacturers is the industry’s top lobbyist.\n\nEducation: $1,633,122,450\n\nPolitical contributions and lobbying efforts from the education industry come mostly from individual educators or administrators, as educational institutions are not usually able to form PACs. Areas of interest for educators and education lobbyists include the federal budget (allocations for research money, programs, and student aid) and student loans, and specifically the Student Loan Fairness Act, which prevented student loans from doubling when the congressional agreement expired. The top lobbying spender in 2018 is the Association of American Medical Colleges, spending $2.5 million.\n\nHospitals/ Nursing Homes: $1,604,696,566\n\nThis category includes all healthcare institutions - hospitals, nursing homes, hospice providers, and drug and alcohol inpatient centers. Lobbying in this industry was especially active in 2009 and again in 2017 with legislative actions involving health care and the Affordable Care Act. At present, lobbyist efforts in the sector are generally focused on cost management, insurance allocations, spending on employee training, prevention of physician pay reductions, and costs associated with Medicaid and Medicare. The leading spender in 2018 is the American Hospital Association, with $11.4 million. \n\nSource\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/investing/which-industry-spends-most-lobbying-antm-so/',

            ['I went on to state:  “In a tiny town in Mexico called Tepoztlán, there is a mountain on the top of which is the ruins of a temple dedicated to Quetzalcoatl—the Christ-figure of Central and South America; a mountain which I have climbed several times.  However, on the night of September 17, 1985, I was carried up on that mountain, in a Vision-Like Experience, with a few friends of mine.  As we reached the top of the mountain, a Wheel, or what you call an ‘unidentified flying object’, appeared at the side of the mountain and I was called from The Wheel, to come up into The Wheel.  Three metal legs appeared from The Wheel, giving me the impression that it was going to land, but it never came over the mountain.  Being somewhat afraid, I called to the members of my party to come with me, but a voice from The Wheel spoke saying, ‘Not them; just you.’  I was told to relax and a beam of light came from The Wheel and I was carried up on this beam of light into The Wheel.  I sat next to the pilot, however, I could not see him—I could only feel his presence.  As The Wheel lifted off from the side of the mountain, moving at a terrific speed, I knew I was being transported to The Great Mother Wheel, or ‘The Mother Plane’, which is a human-built planet, a half-mile by a half-mile, which the Honorable Elijah Muhammad taught us of for over 60 years.  The pilot, knowing that I was fearful of seeing this great, mechanical object in the sky, maneuvered his craft in such a way that I would not see The Mother Plane and then backed quickly into it and docked in a tunnel.  I was escorted by the pilot to a door and admitted into a room. \n\n“I shall not bother you with a description of the room, but suffice it to say that at the center of the ceiling was a speaker, and through this speaker I heard the voice of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad speaking to me as clearly as you hear my voice this morning.  He spoke in short cryptic sentences; and as he spoke, a scroll full of cursive writing rolled down in front of my eyes—but it was a projection of what was being written in my mind!  As I attempted to read the cursive writing, which was in English, the scroll disappeared and the Honorable Elijah Muhammad began to speak to me again.  He said, and I quote: ‘President Reagan has met with the Joint Chiefs of Staff to plan a war. I want you to hold a press conference in Washington, D.C., and make known their plan—and say to the world that you got the information from me, Elijah Muhammad, on The Wheel.’  He said to me that he would not permit me to see him at that time; but he said that I had ‘one more thing to do’, and when that one more thing was done, I could come again to The Wheel, and I would be permitted to see him face to face.  He then dismissed me; and I entered the small Wheel and the pilot—whom I still could not see—moved the craft out of the tunnel and took it up to a terrific height and maneuvered his craft that I might look down upon The Mother Wheel, and I saw a city in the sky.  With great speed it brought me back to earth and dropped me off near Washington where I then proceeded into this city to make The Announcement.  After I awakened that night, that Vision-Like Experience seemed to vanish from my mind. However, on the morning of September 19, 1985, a great earthquake struck Mexico City”—on the Richter scale it was “8.1”—“and it was felt as far away as Tepoztlán, the little town where I was staying.  The earthquake eventually brought the vision forcibly to my mind; and I spoke it later that morning for the first time to my wife, Khadijah Farrakhan Muhammad, and to Sister (Mother) Tynnetta Muhammad, in the city of Cuernavaca, in Morales, Mexico.”\n\nhttp://www.finalcall.com/artman/publish/minister_louis_farrakhan_9/article_101093.shtml',

Yes, even in the US. It is not an absolute, you have to weight it against other rights. Those are defined different in different countries, so I\'m not arguing about the law here, I\'m arguing about morality.\n\nYou have the right not to be slandered. You have the right to not have lies made up about you. You have the right to not be harassed. You do *not* have the right to lie to people and mislead them to sell them your power-pills.\n\nAlex Jones, Milo Whatshisname and others have violated the rights of others in so, so many ways, and they have done that *so blatantly and with full knowledge of their actions*, that I simply cannot accept that "but my free speech" is the one argument why they should just be allowed to continue to do what they do.\n\nFree speech is one of the most important rights we have. But it is not the only one, and it is not the only one we need to defend here.',

            ['&gt;You can’t just say I won’t make a cake for gay people\n\nWell, actually you can. The outcome of that whole fiasco was that the Supreme Court ruled they didn\'t have to provide a special service (i.e. a custom ordered caked), but they couldn\'t refuse them a standard cake that was already prepared and put on display for sale, (i.e. the ones that are out and can be purchased by anyone who comes into the store). It\'s because the bakery is a private business and has the right to refuse service for extenuating reasons, as the owners have just as much right to religious freedom as the gay couple has to equal rights. (And actually just fyi, there\'s nothing in the Constitution that talks about equal rights, so it wouldn\'t be "unconstitutional" just illegal.)\n\nIt\'s not a perfectly black and white line but the point is that Twitter and the bakery issue are very similar, but the attitude towards Twitter by the left/media does not reflect what they felt about the bakery at all.\n\nAs to the discussion of Twitter, I agree, that it is a private company and has the right to determine how their service works and operates, the same way the bakery is. However, at the same time, both have to adhere to the law of the land.\n\nBear with me on this next bit, as it might seem like irrelevant but it will come full circle, I promise. If you\'ve every studied contract law, you\'d know that one of the basic tenants of contracts is that even if two parties agree on a stipulation of the agreement (example: "X will provide a home remodel to Y, in return for $10,000), it won\'t be a valid contract if the stipulation is illegal (example: you can\'t agree to a contract which states: "X will provide a home remodel to Y, if they become X\'s slave") and the two parties cannot agree to a contract.\n\nOne of the arguments with Twitter\'s TOS is that, despite having the rules about harassment/hate speech etc. is that it isn\'t actually legal to restrict freedom of speech in this way. Therefore, everyone on Twitter, despite having agreed to the TOS when signing up and making an account, can\'t actually agree to the terms, because they aren\'t a valid, law-abiding contract.\n\nYou might say that there\'s nothing in the TOS that is illegal, as they have the choice to dictate what type of speech/ what things are said on their platform. That would be true for the vast majority of private businesses, however, there is also an area of law that concerns situations where private organizations become so intertwined with public life that those same rules don\'t apply. One example of this is private schools; even though private schools can make many rules about their institution that they want (such as all girls/boys, what courses they offer, how long their school day is, how many days their school year lasts, etc.) they cannot make rules about things like freedom of speech, or bypass search and seizure rights (they can\'t look through your locker without reason), whereas a private business such as your place of employment can in fact look through your workspace without cause.\n\nThere is a very strong argument that social media has become so ingrained in everyday life that Twitter/Facebook/etc should become semi-public organizations, and should not be allowed to regulate what forms of speech are allowed on their services. I would agree with this sentiment, as to me, it doesn\'t seem like a service which prides itself on being a "public forum" for the masses, should be permitted to dictate what is said on said forum. Combined with what said earlier about the TOS possibly not being exactly constitutional, this would seem like the direction to go in.\n\nSorry if that was long-winded, but I hope I got the main points across.\n\n&amp;#x200B;',

Facebook *may* collect and save data on an individual who isn\'t a user in the following ways:\n\n* Imagine this: your friend Jane Roe, (a Facebook user) posts a status update saying "My friend John Doe and I went fishing this weekend. It was great!" You, John Doe, are not a Facebook user. But through the Terms of Service agreed to by your friend Jane, Facebook is allowed to do pretty much whatever it wants with her post. So they extract your name and start and note that you, John Doe, like fishing. You may not like it, but there\'s absolutely nothing illegal being done. EDIT: this isn\'t literally the only way that Facebook could collect info on non-users from it\'s users. My point is that this is the pattern by which it organically generates data on non-users.\n* They obtain it from a third party, who presumably obtained it legally and is legally allowed to sell/transfer/sub-license it. If they didn\'t obtain it legally, your issue should be with that third party. You might legitimately take issue with Facebook if they knew it was obtained illegally and still received it from the third party, but that\'s a rather unique scenario.\n\nHonestly, I can\'t think of any other way that they would or could collect data about non-users.

Be careful, your bigotry is showing.\n\nHow is the opportunity to serve in the military a special right? There is no restriction on race in the military, there shouldn’t be an outright ban for a group of people based on their gender identity.\n\nBack when segregation was abolished, conservatives similarly whined about the “special rights” given to nonwhites, when in reality it was just giving an equal opportunity to everyone regardless of race. It’s the same with LGBT rights today. No one is asking for a special set of rules, or to be treated better than non-LGBT people, they’re just asking to be treated equally.\n\n10 years ago, LGBT people couldn’t openly serve in the military at all.

It has so much overwhelming evidence that it’s not in the realm of scientific literacy to say it’s not happening. \n\nYour “belief” that the sun is getting hotter and causing global warming is laughably false and has zero supporting evidence. There’s an 11-year solar cycle that causes the brightness of the sun to fluctuate about 0.1 percent, but that’s a stable cycle and the average luminosity of our multi-billion year old sun is stable on human timescales.\n\nPlease tell me where you see the sun getting hotter. https://imgur.com/a/yRsxJJh/\n\nSource: https://www.pmodwrc.ch/en/research-development/solar-physics/tsi-composite/\n\nThe sun is actually cooler than it’s been in half a century, and the total contribution of temperature increase from ALL natural sources is 0.1 C since 1950. The vast majority of global temperature increase is from human activity, and that fact doesn’t care about your uninformed opinion.\n\n&gt;\tI believe there is a possibility that foreign nations are funding special interest groups in order to undermine U.S. production.\n\nZero evidence for that unfounded belief. I feel like we’re seeing a trend here: you believe whatever makes you feel good, and ignore all evidence to the contrary. Even now I bet you’re experiencing some cognitive dissonance which you’ll remedy by dismissing all of modern science, the kind of science you’re relying on right now to communicate with me, as some liberal conspiracy. What’s more likely: all scientists around the world, people who are fiercely competitive and enjoy proving their colleagues wrong, have all conspired against you to push climate change as an idea; OR the largest corporations to ever exist would lose a lot of money if forced to confront the unsustainable use of fossil fuels, which their company sells? Which is more likely to you?\n\nEven BP finally confirmed human-caused climate change, using their own scientists and research. So you’re less accepting of scientific evidence than BP.\n\nI’m not going to continue responding you to you, or trying to provide you with evidence to counter your beliefs, because you’re just going to continue believing whatever you want to.

Because editorial control over one’s own medium has *always* existed and some enforcement of community standards has *always* likewise existed.  Freedom of speech *in law* specifically applies to the state, because the state has a unique monopoly on physical coercion, and operates on the principle of collective, rather than individual consent.\n\n\n  But if we’re talking about, not legal freedoms but principles, the ethical viability of any given manifestion of exercise of a right depends on the context and content that has become manifest.  For example, I recognize that a neo Nazi has a legal right to expouse his views on a street corner.  But I don’t believe that is an ethical use of that right.  \n\n\nWhen one says that, platforms should not ban, they are saying that, in principle, this ethical evaluation should never happen.  That regardless of the context of the exercise of that freedom, it’s always wrong.  Which tells me that the speaker has not really internalized the idea of it being a right.  Because rights, as you said exist not just as law, but as overarching ethical principles, which are prior and independent, but which subsequently become reflected in law.  But if you say that the right shouldn’t be exercised in any cases, then you implicitly reject the idea that it exists as a prior foundational principle, which means that it can’t actually be a right',

            'most_negative': [['"The Gang Goes Fraternal"\n\nMac gets deputized by Philadelphia Police as a condition for searching the bar during a manhunt for an escaped convict. Mac insists that he is given the badge as a symbol of his power. The convict is caught in the bar while Dee is attempting to seduce him unsuccessfully, and Dennis angrily tries to ascertain why this convict is a more desirable man than he is. In the ensuing arrest the policeman forgets to retrieve his badge from Mac. Mac purchases an AR-15 from online and several bandoliers of ammunition, explaining to Charlie (who was killing rats in the basement and is thoroughly disappointed) that it is now his sacred duty to keep the streets safe. Charlie pledges his loyalty, but Mac explains that a deputy can\'t deputize because that \'isn\'t how that works\'. Charlie suggests that he knows the first people they should investigate (while Mac insists they can\'t be a team); his neighbors on the top floor above his apartment. His neighbors turn out to be upstanding family of devout muslims from a hard-on-their-luck country. During the heat of the confrontation Charlie mistakes ICE for ISIS and threatens to report the family to ISIS. The terrified family promises they have nothing to do with the terrorists and begs for mercy, under the impression that Charlie is attempting to fanatically recruit them to ISIS due to poor wording. Mac\'s badge and continual insistence that he is "an Officer of the LAW" convinces the family that the police are corrupt, and trying to recruit them in some scheme. The family reaches out online, trying to anonymously report the perceived terrorist activity, only to post on an \'anonymous forum\' all the information necessary to identify Mac and Charlie. The forum is discovered to be a scheme Frank has concocted to get wanted criminals to information on their whereabouts over to Frank instead of to the Police, and Frank has been selling the information on the criminal whereabouts to bounty hunters as a side hustle. After Frank discovers criminals so close to his and Charlie\'s home he insists they have to \'take care of business\' themselves, and Mac \'calls for backup\' (reaches out to the Police). Mac live tweets that he is going to be part of a breach team to \'bust some terrorists\', and includes a profane monologue against muslims, after having changed his twitter handle to reflect that he is a Philly Police Deputy. Dennis reads the tweets, and is furious at the continued lack of focus on his skills, prowess, and good looks, and resolves to find the terrorist in Charlie\'s building himself before the rest of the gang can. In order to better disguise himself for his grand reveal he puts on eyeblack and wraps his head in black cloth \'like a ninja\' as he systematically and ritualistically \'prepares himself\', emanating serial killer vibes. Dee, hearing that it is all going down, takes off past Dennis to Frank and Charlie\'s, so that she can live stream the entire thing. It is going to \'blow her up\' on her social media following. Back at the building Mac and Charlie are going door to door screaming at people and threatening them with an AR-15 looking for \'terrorists\'. The Police have the building surrounded and are waiting for Swat outside. They refuse to let Dee pass, and she starts recording them in protest. Sneaking into the building from the roof under cover of darkness, Dennis struggles with he preposterous costume slipping and covering his eyes constantly, so he pulls his mask of fabric to the top of his head, smearing his eyeblack and making him appear to be a turban wearing man in blackface. Outside the Police have begun struggling with protestors, who believe that the Police are responsible for a string of racist tweets that Mac has created. Dee excitedly begins recording. Meanwhile Dennis enters the top floor hallway and is about to try to kick in the first door, but Mac and Charlie reach the top floor and spot him first. Seeing only a terrorist, Mac and Charlie scream and charge, firing a \'warning shot\' into the roof.  Dennis rushes into the apartment, convinced he is being pursued by lunatic terrorists, and finds the terrified muslim family staring back at him. Dennis sprints to the window, trying to make his escape while mocking the \'stupid\' family sitting there waiting to be murdered by the \'terrorists\'. He escapes the window onto the fire escape. Floodlights from all directions kick on, and the Philly police open fire on the dangerous individual on the fire escape, having been alerted from the \'warning shots\' fired from Mac and Charlie. A policeman screams "He has a gun!" while Dennis is shot by SWAT using rubber bullets. Dee excitedly films the entire thing, but accidentally drops her phone after being jostled by officers, and it falls into a sewer grate. Mac and Charlie disappointedly hear the gunfire and conclude that the police got the terrorists, so they dejectedly leave their weapons in the apartment of the muslim family.\n\nThe gang cuts forward to the hospital, where Dennis is recuperating from his wounds and internal bleeding, while Mac and Charlie try and explain why none of this is their fault. Frank is clearly upset he won\'t be receiving any reward money and Dee is melancholy having lost her \'big break\' phone video. Charlie reflects that at least they caught the terrorists, as the police found several weapons in the apartment of the family above them. Nobody has learned anything.',

            ["&gt; all kinds of black nationalist associated crimes aren't properly reported in the first place.\n\nBased on what?\n\n&gt;When someone attempts to kill police in ambush in hopes that they'll ensnare white officers, but end up killing ones of another random ethnicity, we don't see that recorded as an outburst of black nationalist violence.\n\nWhat?  Yes we do.  The 2015 Dallas shooter.\n\n&gt;Pick any source and adjust for per capita rates. You'll find that Muslims make up 2% or less of America's population\n\nSee, you didn’t answer my question though. What percentage of America’s population is *White Nationalists?*\n\nKnowing Muslims are 1.1% doesn’t give me an idea of what I’m comparing them to.\n\n&gt;You can find Indian Nationalists pretty easily now and find the same English language derived talking points replicated on their social media, for instance.\n\nIndian Nationalists are territorial nationalists rather than ethnonationalists or the like, so I don’t see why they’d be a problem.\n\nAre you referring to Hindu Nationalists or something?  Where do you mean?\n\n&gt;I don't follow. Isn't separatism and nationalism a bad thing in and of itself?\n\nSure, except as a direct response to subjugation.  \n\nAnd not bad enough to ban, certainly not bad enough for Facebook to ban them as if they were motivated by some sort of principle.  Gotta be making trouble to warrant that.\n\n&gt;Isn't white nationalist terrorism relatively rare until the last two years?\n\nIt’s gone up, but it hasn’t skyrocketed.  It’s always been a thing, and it’s always been the leader by number of terrorist incidents.\n\nI don’t believe there is any terrorist threat in the US large enough to actively be labeled a “terrorist threat.”  But white supremacy has been the frontrunner in this country for the better part of 150 years, and it is my view it also poses an actual threat to mainstream ideology.\n\n&gt;If and when any of these events happen, they are all equally damaging to maintenance of the liberal order and ought to be considered morally and ethically wrong in principle.\n\nI don’t agree with the implication that the liberal order is inherently “moral” or “ethical.”  Things could be much worse in many respects, but disrupting the liberal order can be a moral imperative.  Although that doesn’t apply to any of the disruptions we’ve discussed.\n\n&gt;If Law enforcement were to be presented with a case of potential black nationalist violence in America, they would have to act on it like any other kind of violent separatist actions\n\nWhile I get what you’re trying to say here, it should probably be noted that law enforcement tended to be the ones *instigating* Black Nationalist violence back during its peak, and they’d respond much more quickly.\n\n&gt;even if it was statistically less prevalent in the present day.\n\nI’m honestly not sure what you’re arguing here.  Facebook didn’t ban white nationalists just because a single white nationalist attack happened.  There had to be a high-profile pattern before the pressure was on.\n\n&gt;Why not? Were all of their killings and movements totally above board? \n\nWhat killings?  The Zebra murders weren’t committed by Black Panthers, and that’s the only comparable incident I’m aware of.\n\nAre you just talking about the cop shootouts?\n\n&gt;but I doubt they were simply delivering retributive justice to the parties that precisely harmed the black community of the day.\n\nI’m pretty sure they were a little more concerned with protection than retribution, but the only two examples I can find that don’t fit that mold were due to an internal conflict.\n\nApparently some of them in Oakland were involved with extortion in the early 70s, but that was a really localized phenomenon, and AFAIK didn’t kill anybody.\n\n&gt;They ended up killing at least a few people without just cause\n\nLike whom?\n\n&gt;It's because for whatever reason people fear the presence of white nationalism in the Zeitgeist moreso than they fear black nationalism, or even Islamic terrorism at present. \n\nThis disparity is completely rational when you consider the threat currently posed by each group.  WN are responsible for far higher numbers oF attacks.\n\nI’d argue the political threat is more relevant, though.  Radical Islamists aren’t even running for office, and Black Nationalists have no hope of reaching their goals through legislation or war.\n\n&gt;He was perfectly rational, just not socially acceptable. He had a goal in mind and he received the training and preparation to execute his goal\n\nBut his goal was not rational.  His objective of killing cops at a protest was not going to help his political goals in any way.  He was guided by hatred and an unforgivably reductive worldview.\n\n&gt;They both knew what they were doing and understood the landscape they were a part of.\n\nI seriously doubt either of them understood the landscape.\n\n&gt;They choose their targets because they want to intimidate others who politically oppose them.\n\nWhich is not a rational course of action if your “team” isn’t in power, isn’t on board, and/or doesn’t have the firepower to sustain an onslaught.\n\n&gt;Where? At best I could count a few dozen proven hate crimes carried out this year and the last year. \n\n[Here’s a partial list for the US from 2017.](https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2017/topic-pages/victims)  Like I said, thousands.\n\n&gt;I can't find any estimates that put the total white supremacist population at higher than 10,000 in the United States.\n\nWell I guess that answers the question from earlier, then.  White supremacists *definitely* have the highest terror rate per capita.\n\n&gt;Not if they didn't feel it was necessary or worthwhile to the narratives they're focused on building.\n\nBut there’s a conservative media, too.  That stuff is *super* worthwhile to their narratives.\n\n&gt;How much money does it cost for a regular employee of twitter to run through Louis Farrakhan's feed and look for inciting language he's promoted?\n\nAny amount of money is more than they’ll spend if they don’t have to.  Why would they?\n\n&gt;They don't really need one. They could change the entire ToS tomorrow and make his particular pattern of behavior into something ban worthy. \n\nWhy would they do that?  That’d cost money *and* you’d have to make all the users accept an updated ToS.\n\n&gt;They aren't actually strictly interpreting their own guidelines.\n\nWhat’s an example of them not doing so?  Again, they don’t look at every single tweet people post",

            ['&gt;By the way I know who you\'re calling terrorists which is funny because I  bet you don\'t want to go down the \'who\'s killed more? Cops or Antifa?\'  path...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYes. The Police deal with the worst of society and often have to kill people in order to preserve the lives of others. It\'s really shitty but that\'s what happens. Sometimes they get it wrong, and that\'s equally horrific. But on balance, they provide stability and make the country safer. Like all things there are improvements to be made.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Retort 1: You think Al-Qaeda or school shooters would post memes advocating violence against themselves?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don\'t understand what you mean by "advocating for violence against themselves". If it was an image of a kid with an AR in a school and they suggested shooting him I don\'t think that would be beyond the pale. Equally if it was a bunch of Jihadi\'s outside Charlie Hebdo I don\'t think I\'d see any issue with suggesting they be killed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Retort 2: I mean yea it was posted by one of them. They\'re saying they should get to beat up kids and send them to the hospital.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere\'s no suggestion they are children but even if they were a bunch of 16 year olds I would be fine with reasonable violence being used against them (i.e. not if they are complying with an officers instructions). I think that the use of violence so silence your opponents is horrific and we should be very thorough when it comes to taking a stance against terrorism. The police have a duty to protect the public. You only have to look at where the brown-shirts came from to know the perils of political violence. Many of them were also very young, and at the end of the war even the Hitler Youth were conscripted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit:\n\n&gt;I think that the use of violence so silence your opponents is horrific and we should be very thorough when it comes to taking a stance against terrorism.\n\nFor those bike-lock wielding Anti-facists among you, perhaps I should have specified.\n\n&gt;I think that the use of violence so silence your *peaceful* opponents is horrific and we should be very thorough when it comes to taking a stance against terrorism.\n\n\'tis not the same when you attack a man because he believes something different from you versus when a man points a gun at a copper.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso the brown-shirts assembled in response to communist attacks. So as a further aside, Antifa not only engage in facistic-like behaviours (i.e. authority through violence), but are also faithfully trying to catalyse the formation of a new, grass-roots, fascistic organisation in the USA.

            ['Heres the comment\n\n&gt;"We live in a society where homosexuals lecture us on morals, transvestites lecture us on human biology, baby killers lecture us on human rights and socialists lecture us on economics!"\nIn a subsequent comment, the mayor wrote: "The only way to change it would be to kill the problem out. I know it\'s bad to say but with out [sic] killing them out there\'s no way to fix it."\n\nI dont know what [sic] means...  so if anyone can explain that, that would be great.\n\nI think its important to atleast understand what he said, even if you do not agree with it, I mean without atleast understanding what he tried to say how could you disagree with him, if you dont understand what he was attempting to say, than you are just disagreeing with what *you think* he was trying to say.  Key words being *you think he was trying to say*, this is because its your interpretation of what he said, so therefor your thought, not his.  This is crucial to understand, as its the difference between disagreeing with someone, or producing a strawman argument.\n\n1. "Homosexuals lecture us on morals".  This is a deeply religious viewpoint (surprise surprise).  This isnt necessarily an attack on being a homosexual, in the sense off "o you are gay, there for I dislike you".  Its more of an attack on people who do not work to build society up, and the general thought process here is that the absolute best thing you can do for society is to have children, raising them with both the views of someone who is biologically a male and biologically a female, even if you are not attracted to the opposite sex, it is your duty to better humanity, homosexuals do not do this, and thus it is immoral in this context.  So yes, you can be a religious homosexual and live a heterosexual lifestyle because you believe that the needs of humanity outweigh your own lustful desires.  Now I cannot say what exactly he means, or thinks, he could be saying anything really, as religion and especially that view has been so dogmatic that the meaning has been lost in translation so to speak.  But it is important to u derstand that aspect of religion.\n\n2. "Transvestites lecture us on biology" I can only assume he means a lack of gender spectrum.  Touchy subject, I can only say my opinion here.  Which is that all people have masculine and feminine traits, which creates a psuedo "spectrum" which the lgbtq love to talk about with non binary etc.  Its all about being an individual, but creating a group of individuals because they feel current groups dont fit them, its as if they assume that group identity is what defines who the individual is, as far as I can tell atleast.  Now to me, I think its actually the opposite, group identity is made up of the majority individuals in that group, meaning you can be a male with a majority feminine qualities, but that doesnt mean you dont teach boys to be men because they might be feminine, because the majority of boys wont be mostly feminine.\n\n3. "Baby killers lecture us on human rights" so this seems obvious to me, but abortion is murder, no doubt about it.  The question is, whose rights take precedent over the ba ies life while its in the whome.  Does the mothers rights take precedent, the babies, or a combination, do we include the fathers opinion?    Thats the real fiscussion we need to have here, so he obviously views abortion as murder and thinks baby\'s rights trump all rights.\n\n4. "Socialists lecture us on economics" this makes me chuckle.  I wont touch on it, dont want that conversation right now.\n\n\n "The only way to change it would be to kill the problem out. I know it\'s bad to say but with out [sic] killing them out there\'s no way to fix it."\n\nTo me, this sounds like he is saying kill the problem, not the people.  I think that viewing it as "kill people" should be taken very seriously, and investigated, and only seriously considering that he meant killing people, instead of problems, as a last resort, when you cannot explain it any other way.  The reason for this, is if he truly meant killing people, than it would be fair to take him out of office and end his life socially, and probably prison life sentence.  That is a serious reaction, especially if its wrong.  The whole proven guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt thing, ya know?',

            ["&gt;&gt; Which makes sense, there is a white majority and a higher absolute number of killings.\n&gt;\n&gt;Well, it’s also higher per capita, and black people account for the victims of the largest portion of hate crimes.\n\nWhich I am doubtful of, considering all kinds of black nationalist associated crimes aren't properly reported in the first place. When someone attempts to kill police in ambush in hopes that they'll ensnare white officers, but end up killing ones of another random ethnicity, we don't see that recorded as an outburst of black nationalist violence. \n\n\n\n&gt;What’s your source on the total number of White Nationalists, or the total number of Radical Islamists?\n\nPick any source and adjust for per capita rates. You'll find that Muslims make up 2% or less of America's population and make up a very disproportionate amount of successful and attempted terrorist attacks. Then check the global rates. \n\n&gt;And remember, Radical Islamist groups are also regularly banned from Facebook, sometimes overreaching to other Muslim groups.  They’ve actually been routinely banned for a lot longer than White Nationalists.\n\nSure. But the template that warrants their banning can be applied far more broadly than just white nationalists. You can find Indian Nationalists pretty easily now and find the same English language derived talking points replicated on their social media, for instance. \n\n\n\n&gt;We’re talking about *present day,* though.  The era where they could viably be considered a pervasive terrorist threat has long passed, and the indirect legislative impact they had was a positive one.\n\nI don't follow. Isn't separatism and nationalism a bad thing in and of itself? Isn't white nationalist terrorism relatively rare until the last two years? If and when any of these events happen, they are all equally damaging to maintenance of the liberal order and ought to be considered morally and ethically wrong in principle. Not based on a practical consideration about how prevalent one form or another form happens to be. \n\nIf Law enforcement were to be presented with a case of potential black nationalist violence in America, they would have to act on it like any other kind of violent separatist actions, even if it was statistically less prevalent in the present day. \n\n\n&gt;Black hate groups (under which I would **not** classify Black Nationalist groups like the original Black Panthers\n\nWhy not? Were all of their killings and movements totally above board? I understand they have a romantic image in American history, but I doubt they were simply delivering retributive justice to the parties that precisely harmed the black community of the day.  They ended up killing at least a few people without just cause, even if we take the antagonism they faced from the majority as exacerbating their violent reprisals. \n\n&gt; but would classify almost all current Black Nationalist organizations) still exist and are still worthy of resisting, but they do not have either the level of material impact or the zeitgeist of white hate groups.  \n\nAnd that's the key, as far as I can tell. It's because for whatever reason people fear the presence of white nationalism in the Zeitgeist moreso than they fear black nationalism, or even Islamic terrorism at present. Because the fear is based on what people view as a realistic threat to the system versus people doing something that is wrong in principle. \n\n\n\n&gt;Well, we are talking about a terrorist who got kicked out of their BLM chapter here.  Regardless of their cause, terrorists don’t tend to be very rational people.\n\nHe was perfectly rational, just not socially acceptable. He had a goal in mind and he received the training and preparation to execute his goal, he chose his targets in the heat of passion, not unlike the homicide in Charlottesville. They both knew what they were doing and understood the landscape they were a part of. They choose their targets because they want to intimidate others who politically oppose them. \n\n\n&gt;But they don’t even come *close.*  White supremacists kill dozens and attack thousands more every year.\n\nWhere?

I can't find any estimates that put the total white supremacist population at higher than 10,000 in the United States. \n\n\n&gt;Wouldn’t the journalistic “class” have alerted them to the groups?

Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.   \n\n2. **Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights**   \nBecause of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of "need." The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.   \n\n3. **Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause**   \nThe people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.   \n\n4. **Supremacy of the Military**   \nEven when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.   \n\n5. **Rampant Sexism**   \nThe governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Opposition to abortion is high, as is homophobia and anti-gay legislation and national policy.   \n\n6. **Controlled Mass Media**   \nSometimes to media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common.   \n\n7. **Obsession with National Security**   \nFear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.   \n\n8. **Religion and Government are Intertwined**   \nGovernments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government\'s policies or actions.   \n\n9. **Corporate Power is Protected**   \nThe industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.   \n\n10. **Labor Power is Suppressed**   \nBecause the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed .   \n\n11. **Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts**   \nFascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts is openly attacked, and governments often refuse to fund the arts.   \n\n12. **Obsession with Crime and Punishment**   \nUnder fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.   \n\n13. **Rampant Cronyism and Corruption**   \nFascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.   \n\n14. **Fraudulent Elections**   \nSometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.',

            ['&gt;So can you elaborate on why blue lives matter is considered racist? Because I can take your statement and swap "black people" for "police" and the statement would be true, yet you would say that\'s racist.\n\nI\'ll do my best.\n\n&gt;Police keep getting murdered and mistreated by black people, form Blue Lives Matter. \n\nFirst of all, I don\'t think that\'s right. In 2018, [229 black people](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/national/police-shootings-2018/?utm_term=.50f6b9f65bc1) were shot and killed by police, compared to [144 federal and local law enforcement officers](https://www.npr.org/2018/12/27/680410169/more-police-officers-died-from-gunfire-than-traffic-incidents-in-2018-report-say) that died while on duty. That 144 also include traffic related deaths, heart attacks, and strokes. Firearm related deaths are at 52. 22% of the number of black people shot and killed by police. \n\nNow, I don\'t have the data on what the people killing police officers race were, but I think it\'s pretty disingenuous to say that all 52 of them were black. But I\'ll humor you and assume that it was &gt;50%. So we can say that at least 27 of those police officer deaths were at the hands of a black person with a gun. Now we\'re at at least 11%. \n\nSo already you would be making a statement that isn\'t true and, yeah, sounds kind of racist. It\'s mostly bullshit but still kinda racist.\n\n&gt;The weakest and little of black people get all upset that some cops says their lives matter and can’t be swept under the rug anymore. \n\nDoes that happen though? When a cop is murdered are they generally not lauded as a hero? Like, when\'s the last time a cop was killed and the news reported that he was a scumbag? \n\n&gt;Then all of the sudden Black Lives Matter happens and pretty much anywhere there’s a page in support of it you’ll find constant cop hate.\n\nThat one is probably true. \n\n&gt;The simple fact that other black men are FAR more likely to take a black life than a Police officer really drives that point home. Since BLM seems to ignore that point whenever brought up, it seems like black lives don\'t actually matter except for the ones taken by white people or LEO\'s.\n\nOkay, this is the part where I would say you\'re racist because I am so sick of seeing people say this shit. Mother fucker, [white people are overwhelmingly killed by other white people](https://qz.com/556988/here-are-four-charts-on-race-and-murder-in-america-to-tweet-back-at-donald-trump/). Would you say that white lives don\'t matter except for the ones taken by other races? Of course not because that\'s ridiculous. It turns out that you are more likely to be killed by someone in your community than someone outside of it. Crazy, I know.',

Cheers!\n\nWow, somehow this reply did not show up in my notifications, sorry about not responding earlier. \n\nYou bring up a good point in the downfalls of capitalism, with corruption creeping in if regulations are not maintained in order to protect the working majority, and policy-making being too far removed from the populace. It used to just squeeze the poor and working class, now with housing crises\' in Western countries its also hitting the middle class. So do we change the system entirely or do we try to fix what we have? If I thought changing the system entirely would work I would investigate that, but unfortunately the people I see championing major change are the same if not worse than current leaders. This is a question I find debated in libertarian/conservative circles as well as in left/right debates. \n\nAn example of conservative versus libertarian discussion is in part found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVNw03gyLmk) with Stephen Harper and Ben Shapiro.\n\nI\'m in favor of a system similar to existing Western-style capitalism, but with more regulation of financial markets and banks than what is currently found in the USA, for example, and more environmental investment through citizen/government backed research and protections for the environment. \n\nComing back to charity and altruism, I\'m more approaching the idea from a personal one, in terms of smaller communities being more autonomous to help those in the community with basic things and more interaction with each other. While I am ok with government programs being implemented to assist financially with those that have suffered a loss of job or have poor health/disability, I don\'t want to create a dependency on the government as a lifestyle.\n\n&gt;I\'m convinced that a world without central government, where everything from highways to water supply to sidewalks are privately owned and operated for-profit, is a hellscape absolutely dominated by the ultra-wealthy 0.01%.\n\nAgreed. Companies tend to a monopoly, as its the most efficient model. Barring that (through government intervention), a duopoly (prevent new competitors from entering the market). Barring that, (through government intervention), supply chain ownership which means (I could be wrong) that the one parent company owns every part (or some of every part) of the supply chain and parallel services that has a part to play in getting the product or service to market. I think there needs to exist the profit incentive to drive innovation and invention to reduce the cost of goods/services and increase quality of life, but managed so that the most people can participate at the highest levels of society as possible, and allow a path to allow ones social mobility. The problem with 100% (or close to 100%) socialist and communist countries is that they have too great a level of control (authoritarianism) and remove the rewards for innovation, so that drives inventors and investors away, leading to uncompetitiveness on a global scale, which decreases the wealth of all citizens of said country, which can lead to high levels of inflation. In a communist or socialist country, quality of time  after work is best spent with family, not working on inventions or innovations, as socialist countries have no way of providing compensation through market forces for said invention. So inventions to improve the status-quo for all don\'t get provided to the market (as there may not be one, or a greatly diminished one). There is also no market to judge the product as helpful or not helpful on a grand scale, therefore no feedback for the inventor, therefore no improvements that may make the invention or innovation viable and valuable/worthwhile. This leads to a "brain-drain", as innovators flee the country to test their inventions in a market that will provide the ultimate feedback of the usefulness of their product or service. At the moment, I haven\'t seen any socialist/communist models that provide a workable innovation reward mechanism. The best that they\'ve come up with (that I can see) is globalism, that makes it impossible to flee from one country to another, as all countries will have a certain level of knowledge or control of every person on the globe, and enforced through a combination of government control and cultural levers (I can provide some examples of this if you\'re interested).',

            ['&gt;Good, but again, it\'s not up to Business X to make sure the ECONOMY is good, but rather their own interests. By that metric, Amazon can pour all their money to help the economy and do things that would actively hurt their business model.\n\nA merger only has to benefit THE COMPANY itself, not even the company being purchased. If there are no laws being broken, and it does not form a monopoly, go for it. Anything beyond is MASSIVE government overreach.&lt;\n\nYou are correct it is not up to the business to do anything that\'s good for the economy. That\'s why you have government. To regulate businesses so that you can go to work and be paid a "fair" wage. Something that we aren\'t receiving just purely based off of inflation. And sure it\'s not that simple, but that also doesn\'t mean there isn\'t a correlation. The reason they pay you what they pay you, that they can\'t work you until you die is because of government regulation. Economists will tell you that it\'s driven by the market, but we are the market and that only works in reality when we work cohesively. Our mechanism for cohesion is the government.\n\nThere are laws in place that would have prevented this merger. Just like the laws in place that say you need to have a safe working environment. That hasn\'t always been the case and it wouldn\'t be the case without government regulation. I don\'t think that all government regulation is good, but I do think there are some areas that it could be better. Simply said if there wasn\'t government regulation our lives would be a lot shittier on the whole. I think if the government had been stricter on corporations that produce opioids and lie about how addictive they are, we wouldn\'t have the issue we have massive issues that are draining resources now. So again there are places where we could regulate less to stimulate innovation and growth. There are also areas where we could regulate more. I am interested to hear where you think we could regulate more and where we could regulate less\n\n&gt;The companies, the businesses in the merger. I have worked for businesses where we have had to keep on dead weight, THAT is who it is hurting. It hurts morale to know you have a ticking clock on your head, as well as knowing x person has less of a raise coming because of dead weight. Dead weight is dead weight. A business only cares about the usefulness of that employee to the ends of their business, not if it\'s a net boon to the economy. If you want to talk net gain and net losses to the economy, we can talk about wasteful government spending, entitlement programs etc etc. It\'s a deep rabbit hole that comes part and parcel with these types of "economic gain/loss" conversations.&lt;\n\nCan government be more efficient? Yes. Are entitlement programs the biggest drain on the government and where there is the most waste? No. I am all for more financial accountability in government. That is a separate issue. And again I feel like you are bringing in topics that I am not really discussing. The solution I proposed was about mergers where it is only a drain and dead weight because to companies decided to merge. Are you okay with companies laying off people while executives get bonuses. I like to think of these issues in micro terms. It\'s one city with 100,000 people and 2 companies. Those companies merge and lay off half their work force. Do the employees who have a job get more money equal to the value derived from the merger? Do 5-10 executives get a majority of that money? Are they going to spend enough money to keep the mom and pop shows open in this town? Was there merger good for the town? I understand not telling businesses what to do, but if you just merged 2 companies so a small number of people could make more money was that a good thing? The government has an obligation to protect the people. I would say it failed to do its job. \n\n&gt;That again, is lunacy. Sure I\'d like a severance, but do you see why ENTRENCHING this into law is just overall bad? Nothing will work the way you think it will. A higher minimum wage = fewer overall jobs for people, and with the floor being raised, people with little ot no skills will be left in the wind. If we mandate severance for employees, then everyone will just be a 1099 contractor, and no one will get benefits. Or they could guarantee severance, but then it removes the budget for incentives like bonuses. Money has to come from somewhere. You are spending money that companies may not have. My favorite comic store in SF had to close when they upped the minimum wage 3$/hr because of all the taxes and workers comp etc associated with that 3$/hr. Some margins are too thin to be able to pay all these ridiculous entitlements for employees, who frankly, may not deserve it.&lt;\n\nHere: https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/07/19/332879409/states-that-raised-minimum-wage-see-faster-job-growth-report-says\n\n And I am not really addressing small mom and pop shops here. But I will in general say again I do think more people making more money in a consumer economy is good for the economy because they are going to being to spend money, which fuels the consumer economy we live in. Our economy is healthy when people are spending not when they get laid off. \n\n&gt;So? Unemployment is something EVERYONE pays into. Someone SHOULD take money out of it. I haven\'t ever collected from it, and as much as I\'d like that to be a check written out to me, it\'s a social safety net from the government. Private industry should not function as an extension of a GOVERNMENT SOCIAL SAFETY NET. And of course Disney will lobby to pay less in taxes. What person wants to lobby to pay MORE in taxes?\n\nDo I think things are great now? Absolutely not. Plenty of wasteful spending. But you are trying to put the burden of government on private industry when that is not their purpose. The GOVERNMENT takes care of people, thats why we pay taxes. The government wastefully spends and misallocates a LOT of its budget, and so people like you see a stopgap and think private industry should pitch in. That is not their job. They engage in free legal commerce. If you look at countries where there is too much over regulation, you will see less innovation. Capitalism isn\'t good, but it\'s the best compared to what else is out there. And frankly, I think it is abhorrent to expect ANYONE to be forced to pay, because you raise the floor. There is a difference between my boss giving me a couple extra thousand dollars on my last check on his own accord, vs the government putting a gun to their head and saying "You get x weeks salary severance" because at that point, EVERYTHING will have to be restructured, leading to an objectively detrimental situation for all but the business involved. You can\'t get blood from a stone.&lt;\n\nWhy would your boss give you more money? Why do you get paid what you do now? Companies see you as an expense. While you might have value ultimately you are expense they are looking to cut. I am interested to hear what you would improve and how you would improve it instead of shooting down my ideas. The government does a lot of things I wish they did better. This idea that private industry receives no benefit from its employees or from the government is a fallacy. Business are heavily reliant on the government and you. Whether it be them deriving value you from them as an employee, in which they should pay you for your services or as a customer where you pay them for a service or a product. There is a reason why companies are here and it a lot of it HAD to do with us having a strong educational system that businesses paid taxes into. Something they are doing less and less of now. Which is reflected in the ranking of our educational system. And I don\'t know how much longer we are going to be the leading innovator or if we even still are. \n\n As people like you think somehow private industry has no stake in this. I don\'t know how this got rooted in the American psyche, but it is the main question I am asking you. Why do you think private industry should not have regulation? I think there is a balance that can be struck and I also really want you to think about what a corporation is and what purpose it serves. And what role it is playing now. Because what I am hearing you say is that its okay for corporation to not play by rules, but you an individual should have to pay taxes and be regulated. https://www.marketwatch.com/story/america-continues-its-long-slide-on-the-world-happiness-report-2017-03-20\n\n\n',

            ['They don\'t get to set their own salary. That is pure horse-assery thinking. The only people who get to set their own salary are the owners of the company. Yes, sometimes these are the CEO, but sometimes they aren\'t. But the reason they get to set their own salary is because they are the ones taking the risk. \n\nNow if it\'s a publicly owned company, a board is generally elected by the shareholders, who is then legally obligated to act in the best interests of the company. They will do the hiring/firing of the CEO. And they will pay what they can afford and what the market demands. If a board could pay a highly competent CEO for 30K a year, do you think they wouldn\'t do that? They are looking for the best deal for their company. Do some CEOs make egregious amounts of money, run a company into the ground, have a golden parachute, and get off scot free? Yes, that happens. But evidently the payment structure is still worth it, since so many businesses do it. \n\nBut by and large, a CEO doesn\'t say "I get to make *this much* this year!" They have to negotiate for their salary as well. If they are the CEO and the owner, then yes, they set their salary, but they are also taking on all the risk, and if they run the company into the ground by paying themselves too much, well... They lose.\n\nAs to your EMT question, you\'re asking something very loaded. "Better off" is a very complicated question. But, I\'ll play your game. Let\'s say a CEO runs a company well. They grow, and they can hire 200 new employees this year. They hire people who are either: looking for work, looking for a new job that pays better than their old job, looking for a new job and are okay with less pay if they think it is somehow worth it... That is, this company hires 200 more people who voluntary elect to work for this company. This company than pays them, oh, 35,000 dollars a year. That\'s 7 million dollars this company is paying out it wasn\'t before. 200 people gainfully employed. Now it\'s obviously unfair to give all credit to the CEO, *but*, at the very least the CEO hasn\'t bankrupted the company and *lost* people jobs. An EMT saves the lives of 100 people a year. For those 100 people, that EMT means the world. But for society? Not a scratch. \n\nThis company has increased employment, on top of however many it already employs, meanwhile it sells its goods to a public who seems to be buying whatever they are (maybe it\'s something necessary, like food, maybe it\'s something trivial, like Angry Birds, but either way, a lot of people are on board with the product, I guess). So as an impact on *society?* The company wins, and the CEO steers the company. \n\nThat\'s just how it is. Nike means nothing to me, compared to the EMT who saved my mother\'s life after her car accident. But Nike means a lot more to society, so I expect the CEO of Nike to make more. \n\nNow what I think you might really want to ask is "Isn\'t the pay disparity wildly unfair, given how important the EMT\'s work is?" \n\nBut the fact is, there are lot more people who can EMTs than who can successfully run Nike. So that\'s an issue. Then there\'s the fact that EMT work is not scalable. You can\'t make an EMT \'more efficient.\' You can\'t make an EMT get to \'more people.\' Nike can find a way to sell 2 million more sneakers. Nike is worth a very small amount to a huge amount of people. That\'s how you get rich. \n\nAn EMT is worth a high amount to a very small amount of people.',

Does the betamax rental shop need to be kept open by the government because they exist, rather than adapt to new technology? Does a diner that keeps giving customers food poisoning keep being open? \n\nAre you telling me the market shouldn\'t matter in determining which businesses suceed or fail and stay open just because they exist. The MARKET should decide who succeeds and fails, not the government. What you are asking for is ridiculous interventionism, and might as well have the government own everything rather than private property. The government has an obligation to protect its people from bodily harm and invading nations. Do you believe the government needs to protect each and every single one of its people on such a micro level? What dystopian authoritarian regime do you want to live in to give the government that much power to keep any shop open just because it exists and someone needs it. \n\n&gt;Our economy is healthy when people are spending not when they get laid off. \n\nThere are SO many caveats to that though, economics isn\'t that simple. \n\n&gt;And I am not really addressing small mom and pop shops here.\n\nBut again, heavy regulations for large corporations and not smaller ones?

Ideally a company would have 0 expenses and only revenue. But if they cut me, someone still has to provide the value to the company at no expense, good luck with that. Again, that\'s not how any of this works. They may want to REDUCE an expense, but you pay for quality as well. You can try to cut all costs and hire the bare bones, but you generally dont get the best quality for it. \n\n&gt; I am interested to hear what you would improve and how you would improve it instead of shooting down my ideas.

            ["I think that the model you propose depends on the existence of an ideal free market to function in a way that would holistically address public welfare. We only need to look at the reality of our current economy where heads of multinational, market-warping conglomerates are accumulating more wealth than they could use in a hundred lifetimes and giving precious little of it to the public cause. It guarantees that the organisations that run the best marketing campaigns (PETA, Red Cross) get the most charitable donations, and organizations that don't get next to nothing. A lot of smaller organisations that do very important work for relatively small communities of vulnerable people would have to shut down. I'm assuming that in this scenario the government still exists and taxes at the rate required to maintain their infrastructure, staff and major functions. I'm convinced that a world without central government, where everything from highways to water supply to sidewalks are privately owned and operated for-profit, is a hellscape absolutely dominated by the ultra-wealthy 0.01%. You might well disagree with me on that, but please interpret my thoughts in that context. \n\nI'm vaguely familiar with the literature on the economics of altruism, and it's an idea I agree with. While I agree that taxing the public likely decreases their interest in being charitable (and in any case decreases their financial ability to be charitable) I think individuals living in a high-functioning socialist 'utopia'*  could obtain most of the personal benefits of charity through volunteering. Those unable or unwilling to volunteer could obtain the benefits through supporting arts or public events and festivals, or likely through supporting the grassroots initiatives that would probably still crop up.\n\nAnyway that's a lot of words but it was fun to think through and write out and work's slow as heck this morning. Cheers!\n\n*Which, I acknowledge, may be every bit as unrealistic as a high-functioning libertarian 'utopia'",

I completely agree that we are lacking on senior healthcare.  This is something that we need more taxpayer funding for.  But wage increases won't help people who are already in this position.  Whether you want to admit to it or not, minimum wage increases hurt small businesses.  Think about all those small businesses in those small towns.  Surely you must understand that making it harder for them to exist greatly affects the local economy?  But these are the people who you also believe we should take care of as a society too.  Should they go out of business so the teenagers who help them after school can get $15 an hour?  Of course not.  Senior citizen care should be taxpayer funded.

            ['I agree with you on all of this, and I agree it is an issue that needs to be addressed, but I truly believe 2m is far too low for a marginal rate of 90%. While this cannot be said for every million/billionaire, many of the affluent deserve their compensation and do more with their money than the government probably could. Consider Elon Musk back in 2008/9. He poured hundreds of millions of dollars of his own money/assets (essentially all he had, literally betting it all) into Tesla and SpaceX in order to keep them afloat through the financial crisis. If he had been taxed 90% marginal past his first 2m, he wouldn’t have near that amount of wealth to reinvest into his companies. As a result of his gamble, he now owns two large companies that employ thousands of people and provides industry to countless others. \n\nThis is a two pronged issue in my opinion, and it is not one that is solved as easily as simply sticking a large marginal rate on millionaires. \n\nFirstly, in order for there to be money to redistribute, we need people to make that money first and we can’t discourage people from running multimillion/billion dollar companies. In this sense, the tax needs to be set at a marginal rate and at a limit that places the least impact on industry while providing the most benefit to society. Keep in mind that global capital always moves to countries in which it has the best potential for growth. We need to avoid capital migration at all costs as that will undermine any benefits we seek to accomplish. I am not smart enough of a man to figure this out, but based on my education and experience, I sincerely believe 90% at 2m is far too low.\n\nSecondly, I believe many governments have proven themselves inept when it comes to redistribution of wealth. Consider the USA which spends roughly 600 billion on the defense budget annually. A large majority of this money can help to drastically better other aspects of society (free healthcare, education etc.), but the government has historically proven themselves unwilling. We need to remove monetary influence on politicians (citizens united needs to go) before we can even begin to look at the rich.\n\nAgain, I want to emphasize that I am all for the redistribution of wealth. But the economy is a fickle bitch and great care needs to be taken in how we approach these issues.\n\nTl;dr - this issue is one that needs immediate attention, but needs to be carried out in a way that balances the positive and negative economic effects. Simply taking vast amounts of money from the rich without fundamental changes in societal priorities will not help in the long run.',

            ['This post is going to be full of posts (and already is) saying that it\'s impossible to police the amount of content YouTube has. That\'s patently false. It may not be *practical* or *cost-effective* to do it, but it\'s certainly possible simply by hiring enough people to view the content in real time. One user here said youtube gets 300 hours of footage per minute. That\'s 18000 minutes of footage per minute. So you need 18000 people to police it in real time. That\'s a lot of hires, but it\'s not an insurmountable number of hires for a global company like Alphabet. And that\'s what I would consider to be the *least practical option*. (edit: Way too many people are getting stuck on the minutiae of how many people it would take. That doesn\'t matter. Even if it would take 1,000,000 people being hired to police it all manually, that would still make it *possible* and it would still remain *the least practical option*, just as I said. Please let go of semantics and try to understand the underlying point.).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYouTube could do manual audits of, say, 1 out of every 100 videos.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYouTube could better track the MAC addresses of computers that upload reported content, or users who post reported comments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey could do better outreach to their posters, making sure they know that certain videos are literally available to the entire world, and that some seedy characters might do something unsavory with them so seriously make sure your video is clean.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey could start a "trusted poster" system where people with unproven track records of posting SFW content get manually audited until they\'re approved.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey could force advertisers to manually approve videos for their ads, which would effectively move the onus of placement onto the advertiser and create bidding wars for the most lucrative (and brand-safe) videos.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey could do 50 other things I haven\'t thought of yet, but that they also aren\'t doing right now.

"What if none of that works? What if YouTube does everything you\'ve said and more and there is *still* kiddy porn on YouTube because it really is impossible to stop it?" If that\'s becomes the case, I think it would be okay to say that YouTube\'s business model is fundamentally broken and needs to change so that it is no longer impossible to keep kiddy porn off of their website. Sometimes you swing and you miss. That\'s okay. That also doesn\'t mean that anyone, ever, should stop trying to get rid of child porn. If a video hosting website has to die so that we can stop even one kid from being sexually exploited, I would be okay with that. I hope that the content creators and advertisers would be okay with it, too. If YouTube can\'t figure it out, I 100% guarantee that someone, somewhere, will. There\'s clearly a demand for video hosting services, and eventually someone will find a way to make them work without simultaneously enabling child porn purveyors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTangentially related: If you are attracted to child porn, I would like to urge you to speak to a therapist about it. Many people go without the help they need to find healthy outlets for their urges, and without resolving the underlying issues that lead them to exploit innocent children. There is, rightly, a societal stigma about this sort of behavior, but there shouldn\'t be a stigma about seeking help. Please do not hurt children because you refuse to ask a therapist for help.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit: Thank you for the gold! I\'m a little stunned to see this rewarded at only 5 upvotes.

Helped their bargaining position, too.\n\nInstead they've cranked-out some pretty cheap, bad stuff. I've seen the argument that they're actually targeting niches of what people want, but I find that hard to believe on the whole. While some of their stuff seems popular with particular audiences and gets some hype, I can count the number of legitimately good shows on one hand. And of those, not every season is necessarily good.\n\nTheir stuff generates a surprising amount of press for how bad a lot of it is. House of Cards won *awards* but never had substance. Sabrina has been getting quite a bit of praise despite flat writing and performances, I guess just for the premise alone. Black Mirror is like a low-rent Twilight Zone for edgy teenagers, but you see non-stop hype for it around here.

And they *really* are.\n\nThey absolutely had the talent to pull it off, but it seems like a couple years in they decided quantity was better than quality and they should just try to play Bingo with people's interests and not care about the final product. I think their original approach, while it got off to a mediocre start, was better: people who ordinarily wouldn't watch shows like House of Cards or Orange is the New Black got into it *just to try it* and enjoyed them. Now I stumble onto random documentaries and dramas made by Netflix and every time I try them I'm underwhelmed. I just expect shoddy crap with no quality control or creative vision.",

There\'s problems with that idea, namely that there are other Kryptonians as well as Daxamites, but let\'s stick with how it was presented for the moment.\n\nDoomsday has an uncontrollable urge to kill Kryptonians due to how he was created, which is why you see him ignore everything else to focus on Superman even with the rest of the Justice League beating on him. He focuses on Superman and beats on him with an intensity unmatched by any other opponent Superman had ever faced. Doomsday has protection built in to his body and, as mentioned, may be even tougher than Superman.

As another aside, a lot of that stuff I said (about Doomsday specifically wanting to kill kryptonians and being genetically engineered in prehistoric Krypton) was retconned in well after the original story happened. Originally, the idea was he was focusing on Superman because Superman was the most powerful being and thereby the biggest threat to Doomsday.\n\nNow, if we drop the narrative the story pushed, the real reason is the writing staff for the Superman titles was ordered to delay the marriage of Clark Kent and Lois Lane for six months so it matched up with the marriage in The Adventures of Lois and Clark TV show.

Someone didn\'t do their job, didn\'t call the cops, which led to a resident in the building getting the shit beat out of them by a drunken husband. His duty, as a doorman was to call the cops, he didn\'t, but chose to pop his head in to see if "everything was alright". Couldn\'t fire him, and because of the Union, in fact, had to pay him 40k and 3 months of salary for shifts he didn\'t work, while still paying a replacement and someone to cover those shifts. We were out 8% of our staffing budget that year because of the Union, which meant lesser bonuses come holidays. So there, hard to fire, hurt everyone else, and those families of the good, hardworking employees, got less. Money has to come from somewhere. \n\n&gt;In the case of a merger I doubt they were just waiting for the merger to put 4,000 shitty people out of work. Those were probably good employees who are simply considered redundant. I do think they should be able to get a grace period to work or receive a severance (3 months full pay) to lessen the impact of losing their job. \n\nWhy though? They\'re redundant. Why should a company have to eat that cost? What do they have to gain? Disney/Fox could lead to a LOT more opportunities down the road, but then they have to eat this cost up front? Let\'s say I own a local coffee shop and merge with another local coffee shop, we don\'t need 2 bookkeepers. Do you expect me, with a razor thin margin as it is, to have to eat the cost of that person? Why do you hate businesses, and expect them to eat the cost for no gain? \n\n&gt;I mean can you honestly say if you lost your job, which I am going to assume you are good at due to a merger, you wouldn’t appreciate this? Is this not more humane? Is this not more stable for communities and families? \n\nRight, but it\'s a lot easier to spend someone else\'s money than your own. I\'d LOVE to keep my job during a merger, but they have no right to. Hell, I\'ve gotten myself fired by being too productive before. I streamlined company processes, in an admittedly clusterfucked company and they replaced my position with 2 lesser paid positions. I streamlined my way out of a job. As much as I would have liked severance, they werent obligated to give me squat but my vacation time. \n\nReally, why do you expect companies to foot the bill for shit that doesn\'t benefit them beyond the law? Economics and policy is complicated, we need cold hard numbers, not moony ideals. ',

            ['So I was a cp (college program) in ~2014. The college program is a whole can of worms in its self so I’m gonna ignore it for this explanation. This is (from my experience and that of my friends) pretty typical. I’m not saying it’s better or worse than implied, because that depends for each person and situation.  \n\nPay for full time employees varies from just above minimum wage to $20+ per hour. Full timers with 15+ years experience in the unions (which have their own issues I’m not qualified to speak on) make on the higher end. Recent hires, even those hired on with a college degree, make on the lower end. Entertainment makes a few $ more (when I was there it was something like $11 rather than $8). Skilled worker (ie mechanics) make more, and I don’t know their salary range. I think wages have risen a bit, but recent hires will still make on the lower end. \n\nThe lower wages are supposed to be made up by “perks” like free park tickets, dining, and merchandise discounts. Notice that these “perks” keep employees on property for entertainment and spending money at Disney (even with the discount the mouse still makes money). However, these perks have gotten more restrictive over the past 10-15 years. Long timers I know complained that they used to get a lot more (I can’t confirm this, and the perks change and may be worth more or less depending on who is valuing it).\n\nMost employees I know have to have at least one roommate. I knew a couple in their late 40’s who both worked there who had to have a roommate. I can’t account for food issues, it wasn’t something just spoken about, but a lot of people had trouble making ends meet with the pay. Typical issues faced were housing insecurity and transportation insecurity. If you or a dependent had medical issues you were even worse off. Many people had second jobs. \n\nScheduling can suck, as with most comparable jobs, but it can really be feast or famine type stuff. A lot of department will have forced overtime when the cp’s leave and then few hours when they are there. \n\nThe work conditions are okay as far as safety and such is concerned. Disney takes safety violations seriously, which can mean even accidents are punished. If you clock in late you get “points” against you and some managers are very inflexible, even if you had an emergency. I know someone who almost got fired because of a flat tire (yes, she had other points but they came from a chronically sick child). That’s fairly typical, in my experience, of most low wage work. A lot of the managers are jerks, but there are some good ones and a lot of average ones. \n\nBreaks are timed closely and you only get so many. That includes bathroom ones. In a lot of jobs at Disney you can pop out to the bathroom, however the same is not true of ride operators (and similar roles). I have heard coworkers, and have had to do so myself, beg the supervisor to cover them so they could go to the bathroom only to be refused. If you walk off you get in major trouble (ride operators are safety roles and you just can’t up and leave) but people have to pee ya know? What is the option? Pissing ourselves on stage? Like they’ve straight up been told to wait for a break 45+ minutes away because it’s busy. One girl cried and we covered for her while she went to the bathroom. We could have all got written up for it. \n\nThe worst, for me, was the guest and manager expectations. The guest, having spent a lot of $$$ on a vacation, will and frequently do take frustrations out on cast members. Disney is fun, but it isn’t a commercial and the parks are never empty. I never got hit, but I had a friend who’d been punched twice. I have multiple friends who’ve been spit on. I got screamed at frequently. And I mean screamed at. Top volume long ranting screams. Especially when the park was closed. I did get told I was ruining a vacation because the park was closed and TestTrack had stopped running (tbh that’s a hi-light because it’s hilarious). Guest will frequently yell, threaten to report you, intimidate you, etc to get their way. This might be getting in the fast pass line when they don’t have fast passes or getting something free. I had a very large (tall) man get up in my face because I asked to height check his child. Managers will almost always take the guest side, I’ve had managers let children who were too short ride because parent yelled enough. Which is pretty typical for service industry managers, but those parents just repeat the behavior at each ride thereafter. We can’t let the child on, though, or we will get fired so it’s a major double standard. A lot of your enjoyment depends on your job there, the coworkers, and managers (so like almost every other job ever). \n\nOverall Home Depot was worse to work for, for me, and I’d choose Disney over it every time. I’d choose neither over the job I have now, though. But I do firmly believe that with the insane profits they turn they could do much more for cast members including raising the wages.',

            'most_positive': [['To put that in perspective here are the industries that spend the most on lobbying. \n\nPharmaceuticals/Health Products: $3,937,356,877\n\n\nSpending $3.9 billion over the past 20 years, the pharmaceutical and health products industry has far outpaced all other industries in lobbying spending. It\'s important to note that this industry includes not only drug manufacturers, but also the sellers of medical products and nutritional and dietary supplements. In 2018, spending was topped by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and Pfizer.\n\nOverall, the industry is primarily concerned with "resisting government-run health care, ensuring a quicker approval process for drugs and products entering the market and strengthening intellectual property protections.” In recent years, lobbying has focused more specifically “on the patent system, research funding and Medicare.” As is to be expected, lobbying efforts reached a fever pitch in 2009, around the drafting of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and reported a high in 2017 with legislative enactments again focusing on changes to health care.\n\nInsurance: $2,704,636,807\n\nIncluding health, property and car insurance companies, agents and brokers, the insurance industry has historically been the second most generous/aggressive industry in lobbying for their interests. In 2017, spending was $160.5 million.  Following the passage of the ACA and subsequent developments under the Trump Administration, health insurance companies have been very involved in the legislative process, looking to influence new regulations. In 2018, the leading insurance industry lobbyist corporation was Blue Cross Blue Shield.\n\nElectric Utilities: $2,353,570,360\n\nThe electronic utilities industry monitors legislative and regulatory action taken on a number of fronts, including clean air regulation, waste storage, cybersecurity and infrastructure. The top lobbyist in electric utilities as of Oct. 2018 is Southern Company.\n\nElectronics Manufacturing and Equipment: $2,230,043,875\n\nThese are your classic software and hardware computer tech companies, some of the founders of the tech movement that exists today. As this industry has become increasingly profitable, its political contributions have increased. The industry is relatively non-partisan, usually giving to each party evenly, with slight favoring to the party in the White House. Given the ubiquity of hardware and software, and tech more generally, it makes sense that lobbying from this industry is varied, with lobbying efforts on homeland security, taxes, copyright, immigration, human rights, cybersecurity and law enforcement data storage. The top lobbying spender was Microsoft in 2018. \n\nBusiness Associations: $2,217,425,929\n\nThis grouping includes small business, pro-business and international trade associations, as well as chambers of commerce. Business associations lobby on issues like labor regulations, intellectual property, product safety and taxes, but mostly, lobbying efforts have focused on civil justice system reform. Business associations want to make sure that damages awarded to plaintiffs involving torts or wrongful acts that led to legal liabilities are limited (asbestos, medical malpractice, etc.). Other important issues also include business tax reform, including corporate tax policy and taxation of U.S. subsidiaries of foreign companies. The top business association lobbyist in 2018 was the U.S Chamber of Commerce.\n\nOil &amp; Gas: $2,096,923,653\n\nAs you might imagine, the oil and gas lobbying sector is one of the most active lobbying groups. Lobbyist efforts have historically focused on promoting legislators with pro-energy views in the areas of fossil fuel production, and commodity exploration and extraction. In 2018, the top lobbying spenders in the industry have been Exxon and Chevron.\n\nMiscellaneous Manufacturing and Distributing: $1,687,618,725\n\nWith spending of nearly $1.7 billion in lobbying efforts, miscellaneous manufacturing and distributing is an influential force in legislation and governmental regulation.  The sector has members like Honeywell International, General Electric, Cummins Inc., 3M, and Procter &amp; Gamble, and its lobbying interests and efforts reflect this wide array. Having spent $3.8 million in 2018, the National Association of Manufacturers is the industry’s top lobbyist.\n\nEducation: $1,633,122,450\n\nPolitical contributions and lobbying efforts from the education industry come mostly from individual educators or administrators, as educational institutions are not usually able to form PACs. Areas of interest for educators and education lobbyists include the federal budget (allocations for research money, programs, and student aid) and student loans, and specifically the Student Loan Fairness Act, which prevented student loans from doubling when the congressional agreement expired. The top lobbying spender in 2018 is the Association of American Medical Colleges, spending $2.5 million.\n\nHospitals/ Nursing Homes: $1,604,696,566\n\nThis category includes all healthcare institutions - hospitals, nursing homes, hospice providers, and drug and alcohol inpatient centers. Lobbying in this industry was especially active in 2009 and again in 2017 with legislative actions involving health care and the Affordable Care Act. At present, lobbyist efforts in the sector are generally focused on cost management, insurance allocations, spending on employee training, prevention of physician pay reductions, and costs associated with Medicaid and Medicare. The leading spender in 2018 is the American Hospital Association, with $11.4 million. \n\nSource\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/investing/which-industry-spends-most-lobbying-antm-so/',

            ['&gt;Okay just gonna give you the benefit of the doubt that you\'re out of the loop - Google (and later Facebook) has pioneered a new adaptation of capitalism called "Surveillance Capitalism" and it\'s primary goal is to capture all data on everyone and everything in order to create better prediction software. Unfortunately the prediction software only gets better two ways: (1) if they capture more and more of our private lives - maybe even boring stuff like how long you read a book, or what color shirt seems to attract your attention more, or how long your walks are, or how long you\'ll drive for food - and (2) if they deliberately steer us toward something and see what happens.\n\nThat\'s not a new form of capitalism, that\'s just a new market in regular old capitalism.\n\n&gt;So this thing is obviously pretty complex, but you know the old adage "if it\'s free, then you\'re probably the product" well that\'s how we *used to think* but these companies don\'t need us to use them to get the data, so there isn\'t even an exchange of services for all this data they\'ve been collecting.\n\n&gt;Humans have been turned into a mineable resource, that resource is then refined into prediction models (and *that\'s the product*) and those prediction models are sold to other companies.\n\nThat\'s a very melodramatic way to put that studying human behavior is a valuable thing that people are doing for great reward but I really don\'t see the harm in the act of gathering the data itself. \n\n&gt;So fundamentally, we are being dehumanized by this process, and left out of any exchange, which begs the question - who does Google work for - itself? Shareholders? \n\nWhat? How are we less human bying being observed, what a rediculous sentiment.\n\n&gt;And the follow up question is how should Surveillance Capitalism work? Any form of capitalism has to work for humans, otherwise what\'s the point? I don\'t give a fuck about robots, they don\'t eat! And if our economy only works for shareholders now, then where does that leave the rest of us who aren\'t shareholders?\n\nSurveillance capitalism isn\'t a thing. The data advertising market serves the function of increasing knowledge about how humans behave, this is useful in several areas but the easiest to talk about is advertising, ads get more efficient thus more valuable and content on the internet becomes more valuable because ad space is more valuable so content creators are better paid so we get more content.  There are some negatives to ads of course, I prefer to pay outright for my content and not have to see them but they have a space in hard to monetize areas where having a cash cost of entry seems unreasonable.\n\n\n',

They've got a solid CDN strategy 2. Google's cache is very fast 3. The mere concept that AMP consists of a lot of pretty optimized shared plugins means that many resources will be re-used on multiple sites - so a user will get a pretty fast loading if they visit multiple AMP-sites 4.

Of course stealing and killing are both unethical, but why did the game not make killing unethical, then? And why is it ok to steal from someone you killed but not from someone you just found dead? See the weird logic there? That’s what I’m trying to get at. Of course it’s all unethical, but then why doesn’t the game treat it that way? It only treats stealing from an already dead body as unethical. But then in your argument, killing someone first and then stealing from them is totally ethical. ',

So your only real concern is maintaining your own status quo and are inherently suspicious and antagonistic towards anything that might not favor you. I am sure you think you are a reasonable person, but you ain\'t.\n\nEquality is not just a fucking slogan you toss around on the internet, its a thing you have to work to achieve, and guess what, there is **always** a cost for equality for someone by god damn definition. 9 times out of 10 people who scream about "EQUALITY OF OUTCOME" are just useless stains terrified to think of the reality of equality of opportunity and the costs to obtain it because they are the ones who have to pay up. At which point, all that nobility fucking vanishes.\n\nSo you start screaming that affirmative action, and outreach attempts are the real bigotry. Desperate to avoid paying any actual debt, desperate to define an unequal situation as equal for your own gain. And then cry when people call you out on it.\n\n\'Cause I mean, you are so fucking reasonable right? Who could possibly think poorly of you, desperately trying to hold onto the share of the pie you inherited while claiming you want everyone to have the same size piece. Trying to argue that equality is possible without anyone (you) having to give up anything unfairly earned.\n\nThat is the kind of person you are, and that is why people hate you.

I’m not talking ethics, I’m talking logic. \n\nI’ll paint two scenarios. \n\n1) I ride down the road and see a stranger walking along minding his own business. I take out my gun, shoot him dead, and steal his money. I get no penalty, my honor does not go down.  I go about my day as if nothing happened as long as nobody sees me do these things. \n\n2) I ride down the road and see a dead body. I don’t know him or know how he died. I take money from his pockets. Nobody saw me, but I still get penalized. I lose honor points. \n\nMy point isn’t that stealing shouldn’t be bad. It’s that the logic of it is wonky. I can *kill* a man and steal from him and it’s not dishonorable. But if I *dont* kill him and just take money from his already dead body, then it’s dishonorable. Do you see the weird logic there? \n\nSo you and the game are saying it’s unethical to steal from a dead man but it’s totally ethical to kill someone first and *then* steal from them. \n\nMaybe try not to be so smug, man.

We're fighting pseudoscience predicated on bullshit papers by a discredited doctor. The medical and scientific community isn't budging on this even a little bit because it's not founded in any truth. \n\nMeasles might not be the biggest deal but imagine if this was something more serious like Smallpox with a 30% death rate. Even with a much lower risk today for major complications, you still have people dying because of it. Hell, there was the article that came out a few days ago that Madagascar had 1200 people that died in 7 months. They have a massive vaccine shortage and people are begging for it. Before the measles vaccine came out, over 2 million people died every year from it. Even today, there are like 100k deaths every year. We shouldn't even be having to deal with this crap in 2019.

Let's look at laws against it.\n\n&gt; The Netherlands: Long considered a bastion for the freedom of thought and expression, Holland has today joined in the European retreat on free speech. Together, Articles 137(c) and 137(d) of the Dutch Criminal Code operate to **prohibit making public intentional insults, as well as engaging in verbal, written, or illustrated incitement to hatred, on account of one's race, religion, sexual orientation, or personal convictions.** The most prominent hate speech case to date is that of politician Geert Wilders, who was indicted by the public prosecutor in 2009 for his public comments about Muslims and Islam, and his release of a short film documenting inflammatory passages in the Qur'an.\n\nFor a reference on who Geert Wilders is:\n\n[Geert Wilders calls for Trump-style Muslim travel ban in Europe](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/17/geert-wilders-calls-for-trump-style-muslim-travel-ban-in-europe)\n\n&gt; The Supreme Court of the United States disagrees\n\nCourts rule on cases before them. We can look to prior rulings for guidance, but it doesn't lock them into handcuffs. The important line in the sand is where [speech translates into action](https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/03/05/in-free-speech-a-line-between-offputting-and-illegal/inciting-violence-is-not-protected-speech). The better we are at connecting cause to effect the thinner that line becomes. Social media makes it so a lot of formerly private conversations are now public. People post videos before committing acts of violence leaving the reasons exposed to the public before authorities can pull it down. That is a massive shift from 10 - 20 years ago.\n\n&gt; Subsequent decisions tightened the tests for what might be considered incitement to violence. **Guidelines spelled out in 1969 added three factors: to be subject to restriction, speech must have the intent and the likelihood of causing imminent violence.**\n\nEmail, texts, social media, and what comes after will make future cases a lot more interesting. \n\n&gt; And? This is bad why?\n\nIt shouldn't be difficult for women to get deepfakes and other manipulated video removed from online hosting resources. The burden of dealing with it shouldn't fall on women who will have to fight to get fake sex tapes or worse removed from the internet. It won't be much longer until we can manipulate audio as easily as we do video and fake graphic racist language won't be far behind.

I wish more people on your side could realize that it\'s possible to be anti-abortion while also acknowledging that Crisis Pregnancy Centers are not okay. \n\nOr imagine if this were a different issue. I personally think the culture surrounding firearms is disgusting, and allowing it to be so easy for anyone to easily murder another human being with a weapon that has one purpose is unethical and disgusting. The prevalence of shootings and innocent people killed by guns is unethical and disgusting, to me. \n\nDoes that make it acceptable for me to create a fake gun shop that lures in prospective gun buyers and then have a gun expert lie to them by telling them that guns frequently misfire all the time even when no one is touching it, and tell them that their children are 300% more likely to die if they are in a home with a gun? Is it ethical for me to host a free "gun safety" course that ends up just showing them brutal photos of victims of gun crimes, and fear mongers into the participants that it\'s unsafe to own a gun?  Of course thats not ethical.\n\nQuoting what I said elsewhere:\n\n&gt; It\'s fine to advocate against abortions, protest, push for political change, and even hold seminars to spread your message to willing listeners, if you believe abortions violate basic laws of human morality. But it\'s definitely not okay to do what CPCs are doing, which is using deception to make pregnant women think they\'re going to a real health clinic to get a legitimate medical consultation, and then taking advantage of that situation to try and coerce their views onto women under false pretenses.

Though this requires inductive reasoning skills, which you\'ll probably play dumb and argue (I hope I\'m wrong) that a redacted study from the \'90s had absolutely no effect on anyone and it\'s all just coincidence that measles outbreaks began just after the "MMR vaccines might cause autism" paper was published, leading to vaccination rates plummeting to as low as 61% in the UK. Despite a plethora of medical professionals agreeing with me that the study has had a significant effect on vaccination rates.\n\n&gt;After the controversy began, the MMR vaccination compliance dropped sharply in the United Kingdom, from 92% in 1996 to 84% in 2002.
